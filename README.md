# Password-Generator
This Python app generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. It allows users to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. 
# The script provides two levels of password generation:

* Easy Level: The password is generated in a straightforward manner, with letters, symbols, and numbers added in the order they are specified.

* Hard Level: The password is generated by first creating a list of characters (letters, symbols, and numbers) and then shuffling the list to create a more secure and random password.

* The script uses Python's random module to select characters randomly from predefined lists of letters, numbers, and symbols. The final password is printed to the console.

# How to Use:
* Run the app.

* Enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password.

* The script will generate and display the password.

# Example Output:

* Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
* How many letters would you like in your password?
* 5
* How many symbols would you like?
* 2
* How many numbers would you like?
* 3
* Your password is: A$3b8*e9
